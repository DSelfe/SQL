--Using a dataset on safety ratings of city bikelanes, this is an ongoing project to improve my familiarity with CTEs and window functions. 

--Query: Show a list of all the bike lanes, both safety ratings for each lane, the average safety rating for each lane, and a label with the recommendation as "Remove", "Leave As-Is", or "Improvements Needed".

SELECT street, safetyrating,
AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) as "Average_safety_rating",
CASE
    WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) >= 4 THEN 'Leave As-Is'
    WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) < 2.5 THEN 'Remove'
    ELSE 'Improvements Needed'
END AS Recommendations
FROM CityBikeLanes
ORDER BY Average_safety_rating DESC; 

--Alternatively: 

WITH BikeStats AS (
    SELECT street, safetyrating,
    AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) as "Average_safety_rating"
    FROM CityBikeLanes 
    )
    
SELECT street, safetyrating, "Average_safety_rating",
CASE
    WHEN "Average_safety_rating" >= 4 THEN 'Leave As-Is'
    WHEN "Average_safety_rating" < 2.5 THEN 'Remove'
    ELSE 'Improvements Needed'
    
END AS Recommendations
FROM BikeStats
ORDER BY Average_safety_rating DESC;
