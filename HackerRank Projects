--First Challenge: Query all columns for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 100000. The CountryCode for America is USA. 

SELECT * 
FROM CITY 
WHERE COUNTRYCODE = 'USA' 
AND POPULATION > 100000
;  

-- Query the NAME field for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 120000. The CountryCode for America is USA. 

SELECT NAME 
FROM CITY 
WHERE COUNTRYCODE = 'USA' 
AND POPULATION > 120000
; 

--Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer. 

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE ID % 2 = 0
;

--Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table. 

SELECT (COUNT(CITY) - COUNT(DISTINCT CITY)) AS Difference
FROM STATION
;
