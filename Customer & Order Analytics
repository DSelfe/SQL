--#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data using the RDMS SQLiteStudio. 

-- Query One: How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?

SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Query Two: How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone' 
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'; 

--Query Three: Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'; 

--Query Four: Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

SELECT DISTINCT Product, price 
FROM Bit_DB.JanSales 
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM Bit_DB.JanSales); 

--ALTERNATIVELY 

SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

--Query Five: What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 

SELECT DISTINCT Product, ROUND(SUM(Quantity)*price,2) AS Total_Revenue 
FROM Bit_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC;

--Query Six: Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue? 

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS Amount_Sold, ROUND(SUM(Quantity)*price,2) AS Total_Revenue, location 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location LIKE '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101' 
GROUP BY Product 
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC; 

--Query Seven: How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum) AS Customer_Count,
ROUND(avg(quantity*price),2) AS Avg_Amount_Spent 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS cust
ON FEB.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
