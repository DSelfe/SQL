--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
--Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL (in SQLite). 

--Creating the table: 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

--Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

--Analysis-- 

--Firstly, I want to get an overview of the data to familiarise myself with it. 

SELECT * FROM Spotifydata; 

--Query One: What is the average danceability by artist and track?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(danceability) AS average_danceability
FROM Spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
ORDER BY average_danceability DESC; 

--Query Two: Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?  

SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM Spotifydata 
ORDER BY popularity DESC 
LIMIT 10; 
 
--Query Three: What artist released the longest song? 

SELECT artist_name, MAX(duration_ms) 
from Spotifydata; 
 
--Query Four: What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs? 

SELECT AVG(danceability) 
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE track_name IN 
    (SELECT track_name
    FROM Spotifydata 
    ORDER BY popularity DESC 
    LIMIT 10);

--Query Five: Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”. 
--I'm epxloring the use of CTE's here. 

WITH tempTable AS (
    SELECT s.artist_name, AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
    FROM Spotifydata s
    GROUP BY artist_name
    )
    
SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS Tag 
FROM tempTable 
WHERE average_popularity >= 90
ORDER BY average_popularity DESC;
